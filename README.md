# COVID-19 Dashboard & Deployment using Plotly Dash and Heroku

This repository includes the source code for my [COVID-19 dashboard](https://worldcovidcases.herokuapp.com/) created using Plotly Dash. The dashboard is deployed via [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Dashboard content

The COVID-19 Dashboard includes cumulative total cases and daily cases over time (2020) from 190 countries across 6 continents. The dashboard also shows high-level metrics such as total cases, deaths, tests, and hospital patients per geographical region, as well as top-N country with respect to a certain metric.

## Data

The [data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) used in generating the visualizations in the dashboard is taken from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). The data is regularly maintained by said organization. The data is updated after every update to the Heroku deployment.
